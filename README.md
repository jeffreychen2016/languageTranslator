## Description

Create a multi-language translator. It can be used to translate English to Chinese,Spanish, and French. Upon sucessful transalation, it will also read out the translated version to user.

If there is combination of valid word and invalid word, then it will translate whatever in the dictionary, and then print out the invalid words in red.
